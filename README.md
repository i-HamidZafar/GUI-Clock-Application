# GUI-Clock-Application
It is my university JAVA GUI project, attempting to mimic the app layout of my phone clock application byself.

The Clock App consists of the four generic modules like normal clock application:
* Clock
* Alarms
* Timer
* Stopwatch

Basic App Layout: 
Clock, Alarm,Timer, and Stopwatch Buttons to open the respective window.Clock window is opened by default.

Clock: 
Contains the digital clock, time is set-up according to the time of the system.
Has a button to add additional timezone if you want through a dialog box and you can select a time zone from combo-box and add the new time zone.
Alarms: 
You can add set alarms by the given add button wich opens the dialog box, and by selecting the time, HH:MM:SS and will be add to the alarms list.
Timer: 
There are are 3 time durations are given by default which you can choose and a button to add your own time duration as well through the dialog box.
Stopwatch: 
Like a usual stopwatch the intial time is set to 00:00:00.00 . It has start/continue, pause and reset button to do the respective function.

Shortcomings : 
After actually documenting this I have come to realise that there are no. of things missing and could be improved as well: 
1. Better implementation of timer and stopwatch
2. The option for user to change or edit the default clock, edit or remove timers, some better functionality to trigger the alarm.

I had to implement the project in 3 days for some reasons therefore I couldn't make it work properly to its best.
